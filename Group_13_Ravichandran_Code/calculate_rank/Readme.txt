Execution of TwitterRank:

Assumptions: 
1. Python version 3 is installed.
2. FileNameAdj is the prefix of the Adjacency Matrix files
3. FileNameDocWord is the name of the file containing the Document term Matrix

 

Inputs: 
i) Adjacency Matrix
ii)Document Term Matrix


Outputs:
Outputs the resultpagerank score followed by the node index. The results are sorted in descending order.

Steps:
i) Install Python 3 on for your operating system.
ii) Open the folder "TR_Calculation" 
iii) In the input folder, put all the adjacency matrices and the document term matrix.
iv) Run the program "pagerank_TR".
v) The results for the corresponding input files are in the output folder.

Execution of KMeans Pagerank:

Assumptions: 
1. Python version 3 is installed.
2. fileNameAdj is the name of the adjacency matrix.
 
Inputs: 
i) Adjacency Matrix


Outputs:
Outputs the resultpagerank score followed by the node index. The results are sorted in descending order.

Steps:
i) Install Python 3 on for your operating system.
ii) Open the folder "KMeansPageRank" 
iii)In the input folder, put the adjacency matrix.
iv) Run the program "pagerank_KMeans".
v) The results for the corresponding input files are in the output folder.


Counting the no of COnnections:

Assumptions: 
1. Python version 3 is installed.
2. The input folder must have the adjacency matrix and it should be named as "Adjacency_new.out"

 
Inputs: 
i) Adjacency Matrix


Outputs:
Output the number of friends the users have.

Steps:
i) Install Python 3 on for your operating system.
ii) Open the folder "No of Connections"
iii) In the input folder, put the adjacency matrices of relationships. This is an unweighted graph showing all friend relationships.
iv) Run the program "noOfConnections.py".
v) The results for the corresponding input files can be observed in the terminal.

Active vs Influential Users:

Assumptions: 
1. Python version 3 is installed.
2. The input folder must have the Document Term Matrix input file and the user list file.

 
Inputs: 
i) Adjacency Matrix


Outputs:
Output the number of friends the users have.

Steps:
i) Install Python 3 on for your operating system.
ii) Open the folder "Active vs Influential Users"
iii) In the input folder, put document term matrix and the user list file.
iv) Run the program "activeUsers.py".
v) The results for the corresponding input files are displayed in the terminal.
