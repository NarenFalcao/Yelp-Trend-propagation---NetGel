# Yelp-Trend-propagation---NetGel

We introduce Machine Learning Algorithms to find out the potential and influential node(user) based on the several parameters (number of followers, user's previous likings, previous influence). We identify who the trend setters are and how the userâ€™s choices and ratings influence their social circle. 

Check the Presentation.pptx for more information. Demo will be posted soon.
