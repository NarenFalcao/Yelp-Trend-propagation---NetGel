step 1 - set fixed deatils and run details
  - calculate all run details
    - user_id_index
    - random_number
    - run_number - user_id_index + random_number

    - fixed input_dir
    - first output_dir = output_dir+run_number

    - second input_dir = next_output_dir+run_number
    - second output_dir = next_output_dir+run_number

    - name of second run Adjacency list

  - set fixed details
    - database name
    - original Adjacency list
    - User id mapping list
    - User id vector mapping list

  - Dump this as a json dump as run txt with run number
    - have two hashes based on run 1 and run 2 with common details and changing details

step 2 - call narens script
  - pass params to pyhton script with runscript name and run number
  - pick all details based on run
  - see if output comes based on that 
  - see if input matrices are taken based on output
